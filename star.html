<p>Stars are massive sphere of plasma held together by gravity. As you know Earth’s nearest star is the Sun at the center of the Solar System. It has a diameter of about 1,392,684 km.However, compared to many of the other stars discovered in the Universe our central stars is very small. Some other stars are visible from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points due to their huge distance. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations, and the brightest stars gained proper names. The below is the list of <strong>top 10 largest stars</strong> known in the universe:</p>
